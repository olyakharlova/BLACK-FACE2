I am **18** years old and in April I will be **19**! I'm living in Moscow, but actually my small homeland is **Ulan-Ude**. 
Now I'm a student of the *HSE*. You can see my schedule on Fridays below

| Time  | Subject            | 
|-------|--------------------|
| 9:00  | Spanish            |   
| 10:30 | Video English      |   
| 12:10 | English literature |   
| 15:10 | WCH lection        |

I have a brother, who is also studying in Moscow. He is from another university and we meet several times a month.
Many of my friends moved to Moscow as well. Two of my good friends from Ulan-Ude are studying in the HSE too. 

# MY INTERESTS #
I like drawing and playing the piano, but now if I have a spare time, I'd rather spend it on sleeping. Also I like watching different movies.
### Some of my favourite films:
1. Lord of the Rings
2. Interstellar
3. Flipped
4. Guardians of the Galaxy
5. Constantin
6. American History X

# MY HOLIDAYS #
On winter holidays I was in U-U with my family and friends. Winter in my city is quiet cold. There is a lot of snow and it doesn't melt. And each year we go skating or snowboarding with my dad and brother or with my friends. 
My family is big, so it is never boring at home. Next time I will go to Ulan-Ude on summer holidays, so I'm looking forward to see everyone again. But now I need to work and study hard.

Well, that's all I wanted to tell, if you'd like to ask me something more, don't hesitate and write me **VK**. *BYE!*
